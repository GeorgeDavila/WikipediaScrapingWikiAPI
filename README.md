# WikipediaScrapingWikiAPI
Scraping Wikipedia using the python wrapper of Wikipedia's WikiMedia API

In this particular instance I scrape wikipedia for info about every type of rodent known to man. Its probably one of the most comprehensive rodent-focused documents out there. 

All code necessary is included in the attached notebook at https://github.com/GeorgeDavila/WikipediaScrapingWikiAPI/blob/master/WikipediaScrape.ipynb
All notes about the code are written in the notebook

To run it all you can pretty much just Run All Cells

For best experience use Google CoLab. Thats where I coded it in the first place. Formatting looks best in there. 


The output, scraping for info about all kinds of rodents, can be found in the txt file List_of_rodents_output_text.txt
